Here is my interractive meet landing project built with Html and CSS.

The @media queries property, viewport and grid-view attributes of the css were used  to make it more interactive, responsive and diverse in it's layout depending on the device's screen size. 

To see the documentation and release notes please check the [README](https://github.com/MUKI1Z/meet-landing-project.git)
