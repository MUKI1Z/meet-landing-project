# meet-landing-project
Here is my interractive meet landing project built with Html and CSS.

The @media property of the css was used  to make it more interractive and diverse in it's layout depending on the device's screen size. 

To see the documentation and release notes please check the [README](https://github.com/MUKI1Z/meet-landing-project.git)
